# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview

In this project I have been working with the Independent Funding, a crwodfunding platform, to create a PostgreSQL database. This assignment was about performing an ETL process and data analysis using SQL on a dataset with information about the backers who have pledged to the live projects. 
Moreover, I retrieved first name, last name, email address and remaining goal amount of the backers of the live projects.
All the results and information can be found in this repository.
