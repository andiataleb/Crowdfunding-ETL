# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview

In this project I have been working with Independent Funding, a crowdfunding platform, to create a PostgreSQL database. This assignment was about performing an ETL process and data analysis using SQL on a dataset with information about the backers who have pledged to ive projects. 
Moreover, I retrieved the t name, last name, email addresses,d remaining goal amount of the backers of the live projects.
All the results and information can be found in this repository. 

### Note
